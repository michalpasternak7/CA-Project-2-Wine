    "\n",
    "Computers started evolving with the invention of the Analytical Engine by Babbage. Ada Lovelace wrote the first computer program in 1842. People started wondering and contemplating if there could be a time when computers or machines truly become intelligent and start thinking for themselves. The renowned computer scientist, Alan Turing, was highly influential in the evolution of theoretical computer science, algorithms, and formal language and addressed concepts like artificial intelligence and Machine Learning as early as the 1950s. This brief insight into the evolution of making machines learn can give you an idea of something that has been out there for centuries but has recently started gaining a lot of attention and focus.\n",

    "- Change data to its correct type (make sure that numbers are of type int or float and not of type string, date types are of type date, etc).\n",
    "- Correct misspellings.\n",
    "- Remove outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of technique used to remove outliers is by using the IQR scores (Interquartile Range Scores), following the [IQR Rule](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-the-interquartile-range-rule-3126244#:~:text=Using%20the%20Interquartile%20Rule%20to%20Find%20Outliers&text=Multiply%20the%20interquartile%20range%20(IQR,IQR)%20from%20the%20first%20quartile.).\n",

    "- **One-Hot Encoder**: The One-Hot Encoder converts each category value into a new column and assigns a 1 or 0 (True/False) value to the corresponding column. The encoder prevents the model from weighting a value improperly. To illustrate this, if we have a list of wines, a wine of the category \"white\" will have 0 in the \"red\" and a 1 in the \"white\" category. As you can see, these categories are nominal. According to the [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html), use the One-Hot Encoder for the input values X.\n",
    "- **Ordinal Encoder**: The Ordinal Encoder class is similar to Label Encoder, but you use it for **input values X that can be ranked**.\n",
    "- **Label Binarizer**: use the Label Binarizer for target value y in nominal categories.\n",
    "- **Label Encoder**: Contrary to the One-Hot Encoder, the Label Encoder is not binary but converts every categorical value to a number. Use it to encode ordinal data. According to the [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder.html), you should use the Label Encoder for the target value y.\n",

    "Another more advanced and precise technique is to split your data into three parts, especially when comparing several models: the train, validation, and test groups. The article [\"What is the Difference Between Test and Validation Datasets?\"](https://machinelearningmastery.com/difference-test-validation-datasets/) by Jason Brownlee describes each group as follows:\n",
    "- **Training dataset**: The sample of data used to fit the model.\n",

    "## Perform Feature scaling\n",
    "Feature scaling transforms the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values, to avoid the model giving more importance to one variable over the other. For example, if your data contains the variables of age and hair follicle density, the ranges can go from 0 to 100 and from 0 to a hundred thousand.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways of approaching this challenge: normalisation and standardisation. Let's dive deeper into these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normalisation** rescales the values into a range of [ 0, 1 ]:\n",
    "- **MinMaxScaler**: This estimator scales and translates each feature individually from the original range so that all values are between 0 and 1. As with StandardScaler, it is susceptible to the presence of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standardisation** typically rescales data with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (unit variance). The most common scalers are:\n",
    "- **StandardScaler**: It shrinks the range of the feature values. However, this scaler doesn't work correctly in the presence of outliers.\n",
    "- **RobustScaler**: If your data set contains outliers, this scaler is more appropriate because it works with the 1st and 3rd quantiles and not the mean and variance scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're wondering when to normalise or standardise your data, it all goes down to its distribution:\n",
    "- Use **normalisation** techniques when you know that the distribution of your **data is skewed**.\n",
    "- On the other hand, **standardisation** can be helpful in cases where the data follows a Gaussian distribution (**normal distribution**). Also, outliers will not be affected by standardisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to [\"Feature Scaling for Machine Learning: Understanding the Difference Between Normalisation vs Standardisation\"](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/04/feature-scaling-machine-learning-normalization-standardization/) by Aniruddha Bhandari for more information on the matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common misconception is that feature scaling should be done before the split. Still, the recommendation is to do it individually on the train and test sets to avoid data leakage. [This article](https://towardsdatascience.com/preventing-data-leakage-in-your-machine-learning-model-9ae54b3cd1fb) explains better the concept of data leakage and the reasons to do scaling after the split.\n",
